# Rotate Matrix

## Problem Description

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image. Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise). You need to do this in place. 

***Note***: if you end up using an additional array, you will only receive partial score. 

## Problem Constraints
```
1 <= n <= 1000
```

## Input Format
```
First argument is a 2D matrix of integers
```

## Output Format
```
Return the 2D rotated matrix.
```
## For Example
```
Input 1:
    [
      [1, 2],
      [3, 4]
    ]
Output 1:
    [
      [3, 1],
      [4, 2]
    ]
```

## Example Explanation
```
After rotating the matrix by 90 degree:

1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 4
4 goes to 3, 3 goes to 1
```

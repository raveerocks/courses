# Greatest Common Divisor

## Problem Description
Given two non negative integers `A` and `B`, find `gcd(A, B)`
<br>GCD of two integers `A` and `B` is defined as the greatest integer `g` such that `g` is a divisor of both `A` and `B`. 
<br>Both `A` and `B` fit in a 32 bit signed integer. 
<br>***Note***: DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTIONS.

## Problem Constraints
```
0 <= A,B <= 10^9
```

## Input Format
```
First argument is an integer A.
Second argument is an integer B.
```

## Output Format
```
Return an integer denoting the gcd(A, B).
```
## Example
```
Input  :
    A = 6
    B = 3
Output :
    3
```

## Example Explanation
```
GCD(3, 6) = 3 as 3 divides both 3 and 6.
```
